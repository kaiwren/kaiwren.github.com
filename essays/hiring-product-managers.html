<p>It‚Äôs bloody hard to successfully hire a Product Manager in tech.</p>

<p>The low success rate of Product Manager hiring comes as a surprise to many. If you take industry advice at face value, hiring a Product Manager seems to be the de facto solution to 99% of startup problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No traction? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Product releases are always behind schedule? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Engineers are being difficult? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Nobody on the team wants to report directly to the founder? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Company has scaled enough that the CEO is now too busy to get into the weeds? Hire a CPO.</li>
  <li>Senior PMs are too expensive? Just hire 2 junior PMs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet this advice is rarely paired with how damn hard it is to find a legit PM, and how difficult it is for PMs to actually crack these problems. So before we decide to hire a PM, we need to understand the kind of person who thrives in the role.</p>

<h2 id="pm-is-a-thankless-job">PM is a thankless job</h2>

<p>Product Management is, in a way, what I like to call a negative-space role. There are all these different specialisations in a tech startup that are supposed to work together to delight customers‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt. They fail because of all these gaps between them, which means they don‚Äôt mesh well together. As the PM, you have to study and understand these gaps, this negative space between specialisations and teams - and then slide in and fill them so that everyone works smoothly together to get the product out of the door.</p>

<p>This is a bloody tough job. None of these people and teams report to you, so you can‚Äôt order them to do anything. You, the PM, definitely report to someone who definitely is ordering you to get shit done. Your performance reviews are thankless - if everything by some miracle comes together, you were just doing your job. If the numbers go up, it was the market, or marketing, or sales.</p>

<p>Consistently scoring a ‚ÄòHigh Performer‚Äô or equivalent rating as a PM is well nigh impossible.</p>

<p>It takes a special kind of person to thrive in this kind of a role. The best PMs I‚Äôve worked with are all masochists at some level - willing to deal with extreme levels of organisational ingratitude for the satisfaction of seeing a product make a difference to the customer. Many (though not all) were ex-entrepreneurs. PMs - especially in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2019/05/wartime-ceo/">wartime</a> - have to demonstrate extreme professional courage by routinely upsetting the powers that be in order to ensure the product succeeds. Many young MBA types these days want to become PMs because they lack the courage to startup, which I find hilarious because unless you spend your career entirely in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2019/05/wartime-ceo/">peacetime</a> - which would require tremendous amounts of luck - a core requirement of the role is routinely putting your next perf review or two on the line, indeed be willing to get fired.</p>

<p>The PMs you see on social media who act as though they‚Äôve got this sexy job with a lot of power and freedom are either over-the-top employer branding types, or children playing at product management.</p>

<h2 id="pms-are-kneecapped-on-day-1">PMs are kneecapped on Day 1</h2>

<p>So now that we know the kind of persona we‚Äôre looking for, let‚Äôs look to setting them up for success, haha. I love that phrase, so polished and business-y. But I digress.</p>

<p>Most PMs are hired to solve problems, but are never equipped and empowerd with the resources and tools to solve them. This happens for structural reasons that are really quite messed up once you start to grok them.</p>

<p>To begin with, and re-iterating my point from the previous section - PMs become necessary because the product teams isn‚Äôt pulling together. That‚Äôs a polite way of saying someone is failing to do their job properly. In other words, PMs get hired to address problems stemming from organisational pathologies‚Ä¶ and usually the organization and leadership is in denial of said pathology existing.</p>

<p>I recently tested this theory on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s an exercise - what product responsibilities in an early stage startup can a product manager own that are not better owned by one of:<br />1. Founders<br />2. Designers<br />3. Project managers<br />4. Engineers<br /><br />I&#39;ve never been able to come up with a meaningful list. Help me with this? <a href="https://t.co/eieMReFkdv">https://t.co/eieMReFkdv</a></p>&mdash; Sidu Ponnappa üíâüíâ (@ponnappa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ponnappa/status/1479736075287334912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>If you look at the replies you‚Äôll notice a simple pattern - the PM is always doing someone else‚Äôs job. Multiple responders literally said ‚Äúthe PM designs the product‚Äù without catching onto the fact that ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is literally the job of the designer, so if the PM is designing the product, obviously there is a deficiency in the design group.</p>

<p>Where am I going with this? The most important ability a PM needs in order to be set up for success is to be able to strongly influence hiring and firing across groups, as these are the two most direct levers to address organisational pathologies. Instead, what usually happens is the PM isn‚Äôt empowered to do shit about hiring/firing. They end up having to personally backfill across one or more roles, most usually design and project management. Now you have a product manager handling your design and running your projects but hey since it produces better results than having your sub-par designers design and sub-par project managers project manage, nobody thinks twice about it. Any legit PM is going to suss out this situation fairly quickly and bail on you because their lives are already tough and they don‚Äôt need this added to their plate.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-the-problem">Are you the problem?</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve left the tough one for last.  The most egregious failure to set-up-for-success is also the most painful to address. Sometimes, as an exec, when you‚Äôre advised to hire a Product Manager, the real problem that the PM is being hired to solve is‚Ä¶ you. But nobody can tell you this, so they don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been that exec. You could be also.</p>

<p>So think this one through, because if you are the source of the problems you are hiring a PM to solve, then it‚Äôs going to be‚Ä¶ interesting.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-still-want-to-hire-a-pm">So you still want to hire a PM?</h2>

<p>Here's your checklist:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are you sure you need one?</li>
	<li>Are you sure you aren't the problem?</li>
	<li>Are you sure you aren't ignoring an org pathology?</li>
	<li>Are you sure you can grant the PM enough power and latitude?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes to all? Go for it.</p>
