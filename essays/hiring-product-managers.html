<p>It‚Äôs bloody hard to successfully hire Product Managers in tech startups.</p>

<p>The low success rate of Product Manager hiring comes as a surprise to many. If you take industry advice at face value, hiring a Product Manager seems to be the de facto solution to 99% of startup problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No traction? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Product releases are always behind schedule? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Engineers are being difficult? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Nobody on the team wants to report directly to the founder? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Company has scaled enough that the CEO is now too busy to get into the weeds? Hire a CPO.</li>
  <li>Senior PMs are too expensive? Just hire 2 junior PMs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet this advice is rarely paired with how damn hard it is to find a legit PM, and how difficult it is for PMs to actually crack these problems. So before we decide to hire a PM, we need to understand the kind of person who thrives in the role.</p>

<h2 id="product-management-roles-are-not-fungible">Non fungible</h2>
<p></p>
<p>PM roles aren't fungible.</p>

<p>Product Management is, in a way, what I like to call a negative-space role. There are all these different specialisations in a tech startup that are supposed to work together to delight customers‚Ä¶ but don‚Äôt. They fail because of all these gaps between them, which means they don‚Äôt mesh well together. As the PM, you have to study and understand these gaps, this negative space between specialisations and teams - and then slide in and fill them so that everyone works smoothly together to get the product out of the door.</p>

<p>The nature and shape of this negative space is different in different companies, indeed, even in the same company over time. While industry wisdom does distinguish between, for example, B2B and B2C PMs, the nuance stops there. The appreciation of the fluid, heterogenous nature of the role and what it means for successfully hiring and onboarding a PM is generally missing.</p>

<p>When the startups I advise bring this up, I generally advocate working backward from the hypothetical product manager‚Äôs performance reviews. ‚ÄúWhat does this person need to deliver to get a raise?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat, if not delivered in six months, will result in you letting this person go?‚Äù are the questions I ask to help sharpen the job description and set up the right expectations.</p>

<p>No two product management roles are the same.</p>

<h2 id="product-management-roles-are-thankless">Thankless</h2>

<p></p>
<p>Product Management is a bloody tough job, and thankless to boot.</p>

<p>None of these people and teams that you‚Äôre bringing together through your negative-space-filling-magic report to you, so you can‚Äôt order them to do anything. You, the PM, definitely report to someone who definitely is ordering you to get shit done. Your performance reviews are thankless - if everything by some miracle comes together, you were just doing your job. If the numbers go up, it was the market, or marketing, or sales.</p>

<p>Consistently scoring a ‚ÄòHigh Performer‚Äô or equivalent rating over several review cycles is well nigh impossible.</p>

<p>It takes a special kind of person to thrive in this kind of a role. The best PMs I‚Äôve worked with are all masochists at some level - willing to deal with extreme levels of organisational ingratitude for the satisfaction of seeing a product make a difference to the customer. Many (though not all) were ex-entrepreneurs. PMs, especially in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2019/05/wartime-ceo/">wartime</a> have to demonstrate extreme professional courage by routinely upsetting the powers that be in order to ensure the product succeeds. Many young MBA types these days say want to become PMs because they lack the courage to startup. I find this stance hilarious because unless you spend your career entirely in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2019/05/wartime-ceo/">peacetime</a> - which would require tremendous amounts of luck - a core requirement of the role is routinely putting your next perf review or two on the line, indeed being willing to get fired.</p>

<p>The PMs you see on social media who act as though they‚Äôve got this sexy job with a lot of power and freedom are either over-the-top employer branding types, or children playing at product management.</p>

<h2 id="product-managers-are-kneecapped-on-day-1">Kneecapped</h2>

<p></p>
<p>So now that we know the kind of persona we‚Äôre looking for, let‚Äôs look to setting them up for success, haha. I love that phrase, so polished and business-y.</p>

<p>Most PMs are hired to solve problems, but are never equipped and empowered with the resources and tools to solve them, leaving them kneecapped from the get go. This happens for structural reasons that are really quite messed up to address once you start to grok them.</p>

<p>To begin with, and re-iterating my point from the previous section - PMs become necessary because the product teams isn‚Äôt pulling together. That‚Äôs a polite way of saying someone is failing to do their job properly. In other words, PMs get hired to address problems stemming from organisational pathologies‚Ä¶ and usually the organization and leadership is in denial of said pathology existing.</p>

<p>I recently tested this theory on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s an exercise - what product responsibilities in an early stage startup can a product manager own that are not better owned by one of:<br />1. Founders<br />2. Designers<br />3. Project managers<br />4. Engineers<br /><br />I&#39;ve never been able to come up with a meaningful list. Help me with this? <a href="https://t.co/eieMReFkdv">https://t.co/eieMReFkdv</a></p>&mdash; Sidu Ponnappa üíâüíâ (@ponnappa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ponnappa/status/1479736075287334912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>If you look at the replies you‚Äôll notice a simple pattern - the PM is always doing someone else‚Äôs job. Multiple responders literally said ‚Äúthe PM designs the product‚Äù and ‚ÄúPM talks to the customer to understand the problem‚Äù without catching onto the fact that ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is quite literally the job of the designer, as is ‚Äútalking to the customer to understand the problem‚Äù.</p>

<p>Where am I going with this? PMs need power to address organisational pathologies if they‚Äôre going to fix problem. The most important ability a PM needs in order to be set up for success is to be able to strongly influence hiring and firing across across groups, as these are the two most direct levers to address organisational pathologies. Instead, what usually happens is the PM isn‚Äôt empowered to do shit about hiring/firing, and ends up having to personally backfill across one or more roles, most usually design and project management. Now you have product manager handling your design and running your projects but hey since it produces better results than having your sub-par designers design and sub-par project managers project manage, nobody thinks twice about it. Any legit PM is going to suss out this situation fairly quickly and bail on you because their lives are already tough and they don‚Äôt need this added to their plate.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-the-problem">Are you the problem?</h2>

<p></p>
<p>I‚Äôve left the tough one for last.  The most egregious failure to set-up-for-success is also the most painful to address. Sometimes, as an exec, when you‚Äôre advised to hire a Product Manager, the real problem that the PM is being hired to solve is‚Ä¶ you.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been that exec, and likely will be again. You could be also.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre smart and perceptive, you‚Äôve figured this out and will apply the <a href="https://twitter.com/ponnappa/status/1333656090290966529">reverse-spiderman</a> rule to carve out a piece of your power <em>in proportion to the piece of your responsibilities</em> to hand-off to the incoming PM. Once the PM is hired, you invest time in being coached by them on the skills that you lacked - a common example of this that came up on the Twitter thread above was learning product prioritisation.</p>

<p>So think this one through, because if you are the source of the problems you are hiring a PM to solve and you are oblivious to this, then it‚Äôs going to be‚Ä¶ interesting. If you are a founder, then doubly so.</p>

<p>Hiring a CPO is a great example of this class of problem, and one that has come up several times both at places I‚Äôve worked and among the startups I advise. The business has scaled successfully and the CEO is now too busy to get into the weeds on product every day. Co-founders and Advisors convince the CEO to solve the problem by hiring a CPO, and of course only the best will do. Since the best CPOs are visionary CPOs, a visionary CPO is hired‚Ä¶ and then the CEO grants them all of their product execution responsibilities, but continues to decide what the product <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>Carve the vision out of the CPO role and you more-or-less get a Chief of Staff, which is a very different kind of person, role and problem statement. As you can probably imagine, this doesn‚Äôt end well.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-still-want-to-hire-a-product-manager">So you still want to hire a Product Manager?</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs your checklist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you sure you need one?</li>
  <li>Are you sure you aren‚Äôt the problem?</li>
  <li>Are you sure you aren‚Äôt ignoring an org pathology?</li>
  <li>Are you sure you can grant the PM enough power and latitude?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes to all? Go for it.</p>
