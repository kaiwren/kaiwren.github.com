<p>It’s bloody hard to successfully hire Product Managers in tech startups.</p>

<p>The low success rate of Product Manager hiring comes as a surprise to many. If you take industry advice at face value, hiring a Product Manager seems to be the de facto solution to 99% of startup problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No traction? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Product releases are always behind schedule? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Engineers are being difficult? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Nobody on the team wants to report directly to the founder? Hire a product manager.</li>
  <li>Company has scaled enough that the CEO is now too busy to get into the weeds? Hire a CPO.</li>
  <li>Senior PMs are too expensive? Just hire 2 junior PMs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet this advice is rarely paired with how damn hard it is to find a legit PM, and how difficult it is for PMs to actually crack these problems. So before we decide to hire a PM, we need to understand the the role, and the kind of person who thrives in it.</p>

<h2 id="role">Role</h2>

<p>A common answer in the popular narrative to “What does a Product Manager do?” is “The Product Manager is a mini-CEO.” I think this is a great jumping-off point for understanding the role.</p>

<p>While the claim is true to some extent, it’s worth exploring the manner in which the CEO role is analogous to a Product Management role… and how it isn’t.</p>

<h5 id="control">Control</h5>

<p>One of the biggest differences is <em>everyone</em> in the organization reports into the CEO directly or indirectly. In contrast, <em>nobody</em> in the organization reports to a PM who is handling delivery as it is essentially an individual contributor role. Even when the PM working on delivery is in a non-IC role - often called <a href="https://svpg.com/the-gpm-role/">Group Product Manager</a> - it is with a focus on coaching other PMs rather than controlling them. Only when the PM moves into a functional role - something like a Director of Product - does the PM have reporting control over others. Even then, it’s only over the PMs reporting into them, never any of the numerous other functions that have to come together to ship a product.</p>

<h5 id="direction">Direction</h5>

<p>In a well run startup, the Product Manager, just like the CEO, is free to define objectives within a framework of constraints. The PM is also accountable for their delivery, again just like the CEO. The CEO’s framework of constraints is defined by the board and the market and the PM’s framework of constraints is in turn a defined by the CEO to be a subset of their own. The CEO does this directly in smaller startups, or indirectly through the PM org in larger ones.</p>

<p>In early stage startups, the scope of the product is usually too small for the CEO to delegate product direction. It just isn’t possible for the CEO to come up with a meaningful framework of constraints <em>that is a subset of their own framework of constraints</em> that they can use to delegate product goal-setting to prospective PMs. In this situation, it’s meaningless to hire Product Managers. If you do, you’ve either <a href="#kneecapped">kneecapped</a> them by preventing them from setting direction, or you’ve just <a href="#are-you-the-problem">hired someone else to build your startup for you</a> - a recipe for disaster if there ever was one.</p>

<p>If the CEO of an early stage startup is struggling with scaling up execution, hiring Product Managers can even be harmful; it may be far more productive to explore hiring Project Managers, or setting up an Office of the CEO under a Chief of Staff.</p>

<h5 id="performance">Performance</h5>

<p>The performance of a CEO is a complex beast, assessed through some part business metrics, some part market perception, some part media narrative and some part stakeholder popularity contest.</p>

<p>The performance of a PM is usually assessed through a trad HR perf review process.</p>

<p>The CEO takes both upside and downside exposure to business performance as well as acts of the gods. The CEO can be rewarded and punished for things they had nothing to do with. The CEO performance assessment ‘process’ such as it is, is representative of the essentially highly random nature of the role - to use Taleb’s terminology, the CEO role is a classic <a href="https://people.wou.edu/~shawd/mediocristan--extremistan.html">extremistan</a> role, and typical CEO performance assessment reflects this.</p>

<p>The PM takes no upside or downside exposure outside of what is normal for a startup employee, i.e a ‘normal’ quantum of stock options. However, since the nature of product is to fail, the PM statistically tends to have far more failures on their record than successes (just like CEOs). This does not bode well when one is assessed in a trad HR perf review process. While the PMs role and responsibilities are similar, albeit scaled down, the performance assessment process that is common in the industry does not recognise this reality. Trad HR perf review assumes low external randomness and high correlation of impact to skill and effort. Again, using Taleb’s terminology, the PM role is an <a href="https://people.wou.edu/~shawd/mediocristan--extremistan.html">extremistan</a> role which is assessed like a <a href="https://people.wou.edu/~shawd/mediocristan--extremistan.html">mediocristan</a> role, which is pretty unfortunate for career PMs.</p>

<p>Before you hire a PM, ask yourself how you will review their performance. Like, formally. If you don’t have a good answer, pause your hiring until you do.</p>

<h5 id="non-fungibility">Non fungibility</h5>

<p>PM roles aren’t generally fungible, just like how CEO roles aren’t. No two product management roles are the same.</p>

<p>Product Management is, in a way, what I like to call a negative-space role. There are all these different specialisations in a tech startup that are supposed to work together to delight customers… but don’t. They fail because of all these gaps between them, which means they don’t mesh well together. As the PM, you have to study and understand these gaps, this negative space between specialisations and teams - and then slide in and fill them so that everyone works smoothly together to get the product out of the door.</p>

<p>There are strong craft connotations to this description, and as a consequence, strength in the craft is far more important to index on over domain experience. Strong PMs adapt like crazy to shifting conditions. Weak PMs are rigid in the face of change.</p>

<p>The nature and shape of this negative space is different in different companies, indeed, even in the same company over time. While industry wisdom does distinguish between, for example, B2B and B2C PMs, the nuance in the popular narrative stops there. The appreciation of the fluid, heterogenous nature of the role and what it means for successfully hiring and onboarding a PM is generally missing.</p>

<p>When the startups I advise bring this up, I generally advocate working backward from the hypothetical product manager’s performance reviews. “What does this person need to deliver to get a raise?” and “What, if not delivered in six months, will result in you letting this person go?” are the questions I ask to help sharpen the job description and set up the right expectations.</p>

<h5 id="skills">Skills</h5>

<p>Non fungibility of PM roles means identifying the skills you need in a PM for a specific open position can be challenging.</p>

<p>The only meaningful way I’ve been able to address this when hiring is by using a simple, yet powerful, thinking tool - the negative framing. I ask which skills <em>aren’t</em> necessary for the PM to have for a specific open position. You can use this quite effectively for a lot of other questions like brand positioning (who <em>isn’t</em> the target audience?) and segmentation (who <em>shouldn’t be</em> in the segment?). I’m not sure why, but this framing seems to affect our subconscious biases and produces entirely different results from a positive framing.</p>

<p>So you do this by listing the skills in the team the prospective PM hire will join, and then you drop those from your selection criteria. It’s worth calling out that there’s a crucial distinction to be made here between the PM <em>having skill x</em> and knowing how to <em>work with people using skill x</em>. This distinction is often lost, leading to some <a href="#kneecapped">pretty bad, deeply instinctive decision making</a> around PM hiring.</p>

<p>It’s a given that a typical tech startup Product Manager should know how to work with the following types of folks - project managers, engineers, designers, data scientists, finance, marketing, sales and upper management. It also really helps if the PM can roll up their sleeves and step in to back-fill some subset of these themselves when necessary - I think basic project management and design skills are somewhat non-negotiable in a PM. A competent PM also knows how to own key business metrics, including the goal setting, communication and alignment that comes out of such ownership.</p>

<p>A corollary of this is there is no such thing as a junior Product Manager. You can’t operate effectively as a PM until you can do <em>all</em> of this. There are only <em>Aspiring</em> Product Managers and <em>Assistants to the</em> Product Manager, never <em>Assistant Product Manager</em>. ;) #ifykyk</p>

<h2 id="thankless">Thankless</h2>

<p>As you may have concluded by now, the PM role is a rather thankless one.</p>

<p>None of these people and teams that you’re bringing together through your negative-space-filling-magic report to you, so you can’t order them to do anything. You, the PM, definitely report to someone who definitely is ordering you to get shit done. Your performance reviews are thankless - if everything by some miracle comes together, you were just doing your job. If the numbers go up, it was the market, or marketing, or sales.</p>

<p>Consistently scoring a ‘High Performer’ or equivalent rating over several review cycles is well nigh impossible.</p>

<p>It takes a special kind of person to thrive in this kind of a role. The best PMs I’ve worked with are all masochists at some level - willing to deal with extreme levels of organisational ingratitude for the satisfaction of seeing a product make a difference to the customer. Many (though not all) were ex-entrepreneurs. PMs, especially in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2019/05/wartime-ceo/">wartime</a>, have to demonstrate extreme professional courage by routinely upsetting the powers that be in order to ensure the product succeeds. Many young MBA types these days say want to become PMs because they lack the courage to startup. I find this stance hilarious because unless you spend your career entirely in <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2019/05/wartime-ceo/">peacetime</a> - which would require tremendous amounts of luck - a core requirement of the role is routinely putting your next perf review or two on the line, indeed being willing to get fired. That’s a significant amount of courage we’re talking about.</p>

<p>Courage is at the heart of Product Management.</p>

<p>The PMs you see on social media who act as though they’ve got this sexy job with a lot of power and freedom are either over-the-top employer branding types, or children playing at product management.</p>

<h2 id="kneecapped">Kneecapped</h2>

<p>So now that we know the kind of persona we’re looking for, let’s look to setting them up for success, haha. I love that phrase, so polished and business-y.</p>

<p>Most PMs are hired to solve problems, but are never equipped and empowered with the resources and tools to solve them, leaving them kneecapped from the get go. This happens for structural reasons that are really quite messed up to address once you start to grok them.</p>

<p>To begin with, and re-iterating my point from the previous section - PMs become necessary because the product teams aren’t pulling together. That’s a polite way of saying someone is failing to do their job properly. In other words, PMs get hired to address problems stemming from organisational pathologies, or worse, leadership pathologies… and usually the organization and leadership is in denial of said pathology existing.</p>

<p>I recently tested this theory on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s an exercise - what product responsibilities in an early stage startup can a product manager own that are not better owned by one of:<br />1. Founders<br />2. Designers<br />3. Project managers<br />4. Engineers<br /><br />I&#39;ve never been able to come up with a meaningful list. Help me with this? <a href="https://t.co/eieMReFkdv">https://t.co/eieMReFkdv</a></p>&mdash; Sidu Ponnappa 💉💉 (@ponnappa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ponnappa/status/1479736075287334912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>If you look at the replies you’ll notice a simple pattern - the PM is always doing someone else’s job. Multiple responders literally said “the PM designs the product” and “PM talks to the customer to understand the problem” without catching onto the fact that “design” is quite literally the job of the designer, as is “talking to the customer to understand the problem”.</p>

<p>Where am I going with this? PMs need power to address organisational pathologies if they’re going to fix problems. The most important ability a PM needs in order to be set up for success is to be able to strongly influence hiring and firing across across groups, as these are the two most direct levers to address organisational pathologies. Instead, what usually happens is the PM isn’t empowered to do shit about hiring/firing, and ends up having to personally backfill across one or more roles, most usually design and project management. Now you have a product manager handling your design and running your projects but hey since it produces better results than having your sub-par designers design and sub-par project managers project manage, nobody thinks twice about it. Any legit PM is going to suss out this situation fairly quickly and bail on you because their lives are already tough and they don’t need this added to their plate.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-the-problem">Are you the problem?</h2>

<p>I’ve left the tough one for last.  The most egregious failure to set-up-for-success is also the most painful to address. Sometimes, as an exec, when you’re advised to hire a Product Manager, the real problem that the PM is being hired to solve is… you.</p>

<p>I’ve been that exec, and likely will be again. You could be also.</p>

<p>If you’re smart and perceptive, you’ve figured this out and will apply the <a href="https://twitter.com/ponnappa/status/1333656090290966529">reverse-spiderman</a> rule to carve out a piece of your power <em>in proportion to the piece of your responsibilities</em> to hand-off to the incoming PM. Once the PM is hired, you invest time in being coached by them on the skills that you lacked - a common example of this that came up on the Twitter thread above was learning product prioritisation.</p>

<p>So think this one through, because if you are the source of the problems you are hiring a PM to solve and you are oblivious to this, then it’s going to be… interesting. If you are a founder, then doubly so.</p>

<p>Hiring a CPO is a great example of this class of problem, and one that has come up several times both at places I’ve worked and among the startups I advise. The business has scaled successfully and the CEO is now too busy to get into the weeds on product every day. Co-founders and Advisors convince the CEO to solve the problem by hiring a CPO, and of course only the best will do. Since the best CPOs are visionary CPOs, a visionary CPO is hired… and then the CEO grants them all of their product execution responsibilities, but continues to decide what the product <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>Carve the vision out of the CPO role and you more-or-less get a Chief of Staff, which is a very different kind of person, role and problem statement. As you can probably imagine, this doesn’t end well.</p>

<h2 id="still-want-to-hire-a-product-manager">Still want to hire a Product Manager?</h2>

<p>Here’s your checklist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you sure you need one?</li>
  <li>Are you sure you aren’t the problem?</li>
  <li>Are you sure you aren’t avoiding an org pathology?</li>
  <li>Are you sure you can grant the PM enough power and latitude?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes to all? Go for it.</p>
